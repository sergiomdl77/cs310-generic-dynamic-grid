# cs310-generic-dynamic-grid
This Application will define a generic two-dimensional grid that can be sure to implement various 
kinds of 2D tables. Normal table operations will be supported, including appending,inserting,and
remoing rows and columns. The table will be generic so that it can be used to represent different 
kinds of binary operations such as integer multiplications or string concatenations.
